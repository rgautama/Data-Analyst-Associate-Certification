    "The pet sales data has 879 rows and 9 columns. First, I used excel to clean the data, removing the rows that should not included in the analysis based on the dataset provided. As a result, I deleted 46 rows because the pet type is not one of \"cat\", \"dog\", \"fish\", \"bird\". This leaves 833 rows of data. I also made sure that all the data types from the different columns matches the criteria given in the instruction. I also checked to make sure the rest of the columns were following the instructions:\n",

After data cleaning, all the rows with Pet Types \"hamster\" and \"rabbit\" are deleted as mentioned in the above paragraph, leaving 4 unique Pet Types.\n",

    "## How many products are being purchased more than once?\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine whether a product is purchased more than once, we have to look at the Rebuy column where Rebuy = 1 and count how many products there are. In total, there are 390 products that are being purchased more than once. The graph shows the number of products purchased once (443) and products purchased more than once (390).\n",

    "\n",
    "## Do the products being purchased again have better sales than others?\n",
    "Yes. Although in hindsight, we can see that products that are being purchased again have lower total sales than those who are not. Products that are not purchased more than once have total sales of 51,125,000. On the otherhand, products purchased more than once have total sales of 45,587,000. However, this is an unfair comparison since there are more products that are purchased once (443 rows) compared to products that are purchased more than once(390 rows). To have a fair comparison, I took the average sales of all the data and compare them to the average sales of re-buy = 1 and re-buy = 0 respectively to see if the averages are higher or lower than the average of all data points. The average sales of all the data points is 116,100.84. The average sales of products purchased once (re-buy = 0) is 115,406.32. The average sales of products purchased more than once (re-buy = 1) is 116,889.74. Through this, we can see that the average for products that are being purchased again is higher than products purchased once. Hence, this shows that products being purchased again have better sales than others. \n",

    "First, I wanted to know how many total purchases are made in for different types of pets categorized by whether or not the products were only purchased once (re-buy = 0) or more than once (re-buy). The stacked bar charts shows the number of products purchased once (re-buy = 0) and products purchased more than once (re-buy = 1) for each of the different pet types. The graph shows that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For pet type \"birds\", there are 41 total number of products that were purchased once and 28 total number of products that were purchased more than once. \n",
    "- For pet type \"cat\", there are 182 total number of products that were purchased once and 165 total number of products that were purchased more than once.\n",
    "- For pet type \"dog\", there are 177 total number of products that were purchased once and 170 total number of products that were purchased more than once.\n",
